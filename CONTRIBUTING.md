# Contributing Guidelines for hmrc-frontend-scaffold.g8

Hi!  Thanks for taking the time to contribute to the [HMRC Multichannel Digital Tax Platform](https://hmrc.github.io) (MDTP)

We welcome contributions to hmrc-frontend-scaffold.  By following these guidelines you will greatly improve the likelihood of your change being accepted and merged.

## How to Help?

We’re always looking for feedback and help.  These are the areas where you can get involved:

* Bug fixes and improvements
* Proposing new features
* Documentation

If you're looking to add new screens, please ensure they align with the [HMRC Design System](https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns).

## Communication

**Before** starting on a piece of work, **please get in touch**.

We may already have what you’re planning to do in our backlog, already be working on it, or be planning an alternative solution or approach.

Communicating early can also help with design decisions and direction for your approach, increasing the chance of us accepting your work.

Please come and talk to us in our [Slack channel](https://hmrcdigital.slack.com/archives/team-scaffolders) in the first instance.  Once we've discussed your idea, we'll probably ask you to [raise an issue](https://github.com/hmrc/hmrc-frontend-scaffold.g8/issues/new) (using our [Issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)) before starting work.

## Contributing code

Once you've identified (or created) an [issue](https://github.com/hmrc/hmrc-frontend-scaffold.g8/issues) to work on, please follow these guidelines to contribute code:

* Fork the repository
* Write tests along with your code
* Add logical, atomic commits with [good commit messages](#commit-messages)
* Raise your Pull Request against the `develop` branch using our [Pull Request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
* We will review and offer any feedback
* Once merged to `develop`, we will coordinate a merge into `master` and a release

## Commits

### Commit messages

Writing good commit messages is important. Not just for yourself, but for other
developers on your project. This includes:

* new (or recently absent) developers who want to get up to speed on progress
* interested external parties who want to follow progress of the project
* people in the public (remember, we code in the open) who want to see our work,
  or learn from our practices
* any future developers (including yourself) who want to see why a change was
  made
